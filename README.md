# CS350_Emerging_System_Architectures

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The ultimate goal of this course was to take all the various lessons and milestones and bring them together to make a prototype thermostat.

What did you do particularly well?

I think my coding is particularly well formatted. It is legible, well commented, easy to follow, and lacks redundancy.

Where could you improve?

By far my biggest weakness is time management.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

StackOverflow was an invaluable resource during this course. The general Python documentation, in particular for statemachine and GPIOzero, were also extremely helpful.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

The ability to read, understand, and debug the various classes and functions of the various state machines we worked with will be very useful.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made sure to use function callbacks whenever possible to reduce clutter and make the code more modular.
